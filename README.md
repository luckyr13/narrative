## Installation (for developers only)
Narrative is made using Angular framework so you will need to have Node installed on your machine. For installing on your own environment just follow the next steps:

- Clone the project
- Run `npm install` from your command line
- And that's it!

## Development server (for developers only)

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build (for developers only)

Run `ng build` or `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Special thanks

This version of the Narrative Protocol is based on the design created by Sam Williams and Al Morris.
